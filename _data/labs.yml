This collaboration allows ABN AMRO software architects and decision makers to work closer with software sustainability researchers in academia, contribute to education and science, and collaborate in PhD- and Master-level research. Academics in turn gain a better understanding of how real-world software can be measured and re-designed to achieve sustainability goals.
