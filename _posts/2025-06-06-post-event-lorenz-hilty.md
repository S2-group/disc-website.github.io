## The Creeping Disempowerment of Users in the Digital Transformation and its Connection to (Un)Sustainable Development

On 5th June, 2025, we continued our Distinguished Lecture Series with a thought-provoking talk by **Prof. em. Dr. Lorenz Hilty** from the University of Zurich 

His lecture covered the following themes: 

1. Computing in the Context of Sustainability
2. "Footprints" and "Handprints" os Digital Innovations
3. Five Steps to the Disempowerment of the User and Why This Is Not Sustainable

Prof. Hilty concluded his talk by emphasizing that digital technologies are increasingly being designed in ways that subtly disempower users. Devices are becoming harder to repair or maintain, software is turning into a black box that limits user agency, and data is routinely harvested to predict—and manipulate—user behavior. These developments go far beyond convenience or efficiency: they restrict individual freedom, accelerate environmental harm, deepen information inequality, and undermine democratic values. As user control fades, so does the possibility of building a fair and sustainable digital society.


The event featured a thoughtful and engaging discussion with participants, where critical perspectives and real-world implications were shared. The evening concluded with food and drinks, providing an opportunity for informal conversations and networking.
