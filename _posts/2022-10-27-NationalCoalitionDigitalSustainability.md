Digitalisation is an essential aspect of sustainability and digitalisation itself must also be sustainable. 
On October 18 2022, professor Patricia Lago has signed the **Digital Sustainability Manifesto**, 
on behalf of the department Computer Science of VU Amsterdam. 

Building upon our work, among others, on the 
<a target="blank" href="https://amsterdameconomicboard.com/en/news/leap-technology-landscape-trends-and-scenarios/">
LEAP Technology Landscape</a> under the leadership of the Amsterdam Economic Board, 
they transitioned into the new **National Coalition Digital Sustainability** (NCDD) 
which counts about **70 organizations nationwide**. 
In Nieuwspoort, the signed manifesto was then handed over to Minister Micky Adriaansens (Economic Affairs and Climate). 
VU's participation in the NCDD and its manifesto further confirm the strong position and commitment of the VU 
in digital sustainability, for both education and research, and its role for an inclusive digital society.
