Dear colleagues,

It is our great pleasure to **invite you to the upcoming DiSC research cocktail with the topic “Sustainability of Digital Technologies”.** We are excited to share that the cocktail will feature four speakers, who will reflect on the social, societal, technical, and environmental sustainability of technology. 

**What are research cocktails?** Research cocktails are cross-disciplinary activities designed to establish and strengthen connections between researchers within the Computer Science department and beyond. Several years ago, the department conceived the research cocktails. We are now bringing them back to life under the umbrella of VU’s Digital Sustainability Center (DiSC), coordinated by Justus Bogner and Filip Ilievski.
