The Digital Sustainability Center (DiSC) and Digital Architects Network (DNAW) organized a tutorial titled *Digital Architecture in the Age of GenAI*, focusing on how generative and agentic AI are reshaping the design and sustainability of digital systems. The tutorial was hosted at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and brought together researchers and practitioners interested in AI-enabled software architecture.

The event introduced participants to key concepts in machine learning and digital architecture, followed by practical discussions on the role of large language models as architectural assistants. A tutorial explored agentic AI systems, highlighting their architectural implications as well as sustainability and energy considerations.

The tutorial featured expert contributions from Prof. Henry Muccini of the University of L’Aquila and Dr. Karthik Vaidhyanathan from the Software Engineering Research Center at IIIT-Hyderabad. Interactive sessions and discussions allowed participants to exchange ideas and reflect on real-world applications of AI-driven architectures.

The event concluded with informal networking drinks, providing space for further discussion and collaboration among attendees.
