As professor emeritus, he continues his work on sustainable technology design in interdisciplinary contexts.


## Talk Overview  

The digital transformation of society holds both opportunities and risks for the goals of sustainable development. For decades, specialized scientific communities have been discussing the question of how these opportunities can be seized and the risks mitigated. In the first part of the presentation, I will outline the usual perspective from which the sustainability impact of digital technology (including today's AI) is analyzed. In the second part, I will look at the development of digital technologies from the (ethical) perspective of user self-determination and discuss the connections to sustainable development.

We warmly invite you to attend this lecture and engage in the discussion.
