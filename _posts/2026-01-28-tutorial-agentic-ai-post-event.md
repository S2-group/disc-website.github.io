The Digital Sustainability Center (DiSC) and [Digital Architects Network (DNAW)](https://www.danw.nl) organized a tutorial titled *Digital Architecture in the Age of GenAI*, focusing on how generative and agentic AI are reshaping the design of digital systems. The tutorial was hosted at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and brought together researchers and practitioners interested in AI for software architecture and software architecture for AI. 

The event introduced participants to the evolution in the domains of machine learning and software architecture, followed by practical discussions on the role of large language models as architectural assistants. A tutorial explored agentic AI systems, highlighting their architectural implications, applications across different domains. The event concluded with some final reflections on the need and use of LLMs, and open areas for research and development.  

The tutorial featured expert contributions from Prof. Henry Muccini from the University of L’Aquila, Italy and Dr. Karthik Vaidhyanathan from the Software Engineering Research Center at IIIT-Hyderabad, India. Interactive sessions and discussions allowed participants to exchange ideas and reflect on real-world applications of GenAI.

The event concluded with networking and drinks, providing space for further discussion and collaboration among attendees.
