The Digital Sustainability Center (DiSC) and [Digital Architects Network (DNAW)](https://www.danw.nl) organized a tutorial titled *Digital Architecture in the Age of GenAI*, focusing on how generative and agentic AI are reshaping the design of digital systems. The tutorial was hosted at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and brought together researchers and practitioners interested in AI for software architecture and software architecture for AI. 

The event opened with an overview of the fundamentals of machine learning and software architecture, setting a common foundation for participants. This was followed by practical discussions on the role of large language models (LLMs) as co-pilots for decision support. Building on this, participants engaged in a hands-on session exploring different LLM-based approaches to decision-making. The conversation then shifted to agentic AI systems, with speakers highlighting their architectural implications and real-world applications across multiple domains. The event concluded with reflective discussions on the value and necessity of LLMs, as well as open challenges and future directions for research and development.

The tutorial featured expert contributions from Prof. dr. Henry Muccini from the University of L’Aquila, Italy and Dr. Karthik Vaidhyanathan from the Software Engineering Research Center at IIIT-Hyderabad, India. Interactive sessions and discussions allowed participants to exchange ideas and reflect on real-world applications of GenAI.

The event concluded with networking and drinks, providing space for further discussion and collaboration among attendees.
