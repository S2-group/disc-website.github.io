Join us for an exhilarating meetup at the [Digital Sustainability Center (DiSC)](https://digitalsustainabilitycenter.nl) at VU Amsterdam on the afternoon of **April 5th, 2023**. Get ready to be inspired!

The theme of the meetup is **"SUSTAINABLY DIGITAL"** and embraces a broad range of topics, disciplines, sectors and applications that involve digitalisation, sustainability, and the role of society, companies, public organizations, and individuals.

Experience the future of sustainability as our talented students and researchers showcase their innovative solutions and ideas. From renewable energy commons to sustainable software development, our pitches cover a wide range of digital sustainability topics that are shaping the world we live in. 

But that's not all! This event is also your chance to **connect with top talent, network with industry leaders, and explore collaboration opportunities** with researchers. Whether you're looking to recruit new talents, find partners for your next project, or simply gain insights into the latest trends in digital sustainability, this event has something for everyone. All of this will be followed by a networking 'borrel' in the lounge area where students and researchers will showcase their posters.

To kick things off, we're thrilled to welcome our keynote speaker, Davide Ianuzzi, VU Chief Impact Officer, who will share his insights and perspectives on the future of digital sustainability.
