DiSc hosted a 1.5 day hybrid "ICT4SEdu Collective Workshop" at Vrije Universitiet Amsterdam. The workshop brought together educationists and researchers to explore innovative ways to reuse teaching materials and integrate sustainability into Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education.

During the workshop participants engaged in a series of collaborative sessions focused on exploring how sustainability can be effectively integrated into ICT education. Through group discussions and interactive exercises, they shared experiences, identified common challenges, and exchanged ideas for developing practical approaches to sustainability-focused teaching.

The workshop concluded with a collective vision to create open-access, reusable teaching materials that can support educators and researchers in embedding sustainability across ICT and related disciplines.
