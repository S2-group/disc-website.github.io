A two-day hybrid workshop 'Use-Me ICT4S Education Material' took place at Vrije Universitiet Amsterdam. The workshop brought together educationists and researchers to explore innovative ways to reuse teaching materials and integrate sustainability into Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education.

The aim of the workshop was to develop a shared and open-access structure that supports educators in embedding sustainability principles into their courses. This structure is designed to be flexible and adaptable, acknowledging that approaches to sustainability can vary across disciplines and teaching contexts.

Over two days, participants engaged in a series of collaborative sessions focused on exploring how sustainability can be effectively integrated into ICT education. Through group discussions and interactive exercises, they shared experiences, identified common challenges, and exchanged ideas for developing practical approaches to sustainability-focused teaching.

The workshop concluded with a collective vision to create open-access, reusable teaching materials that can support educators and researchers in embedding sustainability across ICT and related disciplines.
