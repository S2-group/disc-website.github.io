Software is everywhere, creating an ever increasing and urgent responsibility for software systems creators to ensure a sustainable world for future generations. Moving more and more software to the cloud makes this already-difficult task even more complicated. In this project, we aim to answer the fundamental questions about how sustainability is affected by the way software running in the cloud is structured, and in doing so, develop tools that help making software more sustainable.
