# Meeting 2nd June

## Me
* What do you think about the minimal theme?
* Are the fonts ok, or should I switch them around?
* Is the navbar font ok? I feel like I should change it.
* Should the navbar sections light up when on that specific page (like the [s2 website](https://s2group.cs.vu.nl/) )
* Would you prefer to have the blue to green gradient in the navbar border?
* Should I try to make the homepage as a "highlights" section and keep the news page and projects page in the current homepage style?
* Should I try to keep the design 1 to 1 with what is in the Angolino pdf?
